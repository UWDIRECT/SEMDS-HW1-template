# SEMDS-HW1
Homework #1 from SEMDS



### Assignment
Locate the HW1 link on the 546 syllabus. Click the link to create a private repository for this assignment from the template.  Follow the instructions below. 1pt each for each item.

Your grade in 546 for this homework assignment will only be evaluated on the following items.  That is, you will only be evaluated on the items below for 546.  If your CSTR model is imperfect, 546 cares more about the `docstrings` you wrote in #3 below.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer per the in class instructions.
2. Edit the `README.md` file to include a description of this Jupyter notebook. Use Markdown to format the file.  It does not need to be long, but it should be complete and include a bulletted list stating what the four preceeding problem statements were.  HINT: look at the Markdown in the cells above to get some ideas of what it should say and how to style the bullets.
3. For each of the functions that you wrote above, write `docstrings`.  Remember that `docstrings` the first thing that appear after the `def` line and are indented with the code block and preceeded and ended with "triple doubles", i.e. `"""`.
4. Add the modified `README.md` and the this file to the staging area.
5. Commit the staged files to the repository.  Be sure to add a suffecient commit message.  Feel free to repeat steps 4 and 5 as many times as you need.  Consider using steps 4 and 5 to keep intermediate versions as you work on building the notebook's contents.
6. Push the repo to GitHub.
