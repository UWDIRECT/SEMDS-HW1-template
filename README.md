# SEMDS-HW1
Homework #1 from SEMDS



### Assignment
* Create your own ``setup.sh`` like we had in class to download the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database zip file and unzip it.
* Create a new Jupyter notebook named ``HW1.ipynb``.  Use ``pandas`` to load the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database into a data frame.
* Perform a simple data exploration.  You don't have to discover something new, but try to justify your explorations with comments in Markdown in the notebook.  I expect a minimum of 5 operations, transformations, etc. on the data and at least one matplotlib figure in the notebook.
* Modify this README.md to include instructions on how to run the ``setup.sh`` and what it does, what to expect as a user.  Put this under the 'Usage and more information' section.  Use markdown to make it more readable.
* Commit the script, the notebook and your changed README.md to GitHub using the classroom link.
